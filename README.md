# CMSC-128-LABS
SUBMISSION FOR CMSC 128 LAB 1 & 2



I am currently happy with my grades for the SCRUM part from CMSC 126 (Previous Semester)

The YOUTUBE LINKS for the SCRUM are also indicated on top of the "app.py" file  along with the YOUTUBE LINK of the LAB 1 Video Defense/Presentation/Documentation.
